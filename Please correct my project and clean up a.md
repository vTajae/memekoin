Please correct my project and clean up any comilation and development errors in the console.

Use context7 for the claoudfalre rust mcp runtime, as well learning about best practice with the fuill stack framework leptos.

As mentioned I implemented some examples from the following frameworks:
https://github.com/soqa-io/soqa-sdk
https://github.com/barter-rs/barter-rs


Consider this documentation:

https://book.leptos.dev/web_sys.html

https://book.leptos.dev/deployment/index.html

conider im using the cloudflare worker:
https://book.leptos.dev/deployment/ssr.html#deploy-to-serverless-runtimes

These are reference code examples:

https://github.com/leptos-rs

https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs/tree/main/templates/leptos


Be sure to test implementation with playrigth mcp














Please analyze and systematically fix my Rust project that uses the Leptos full-stack framework for deployment on Cloudflare Workers. Follow this structured approach:

**Phase 1: Project Analysis & Error Identification**
1. Use codebase-retrieval to examine the current project structure, focusing on:
   - Cargo.toml configuration files (workspace and individual crates)
   - Main application entry points (lib.rs, main.rs)
   - Leptos component implementations
   - Build configuration files (wrangler.toml, build scripts)

2. Identify specific compilation errors by:
   - Running `cargo check` and `cargo build` to capture exact error messages
   - Examining dependency version conflicts or missing features
   - Checking for incompatible target configurations (wasm32-unknown-unknown vs cloudflare workers)

**Phase 2: Research & Best Practices**
3. Use Context7 MCP to research documentation for:
   - "leptos cloudflare workers" - deployment patterns and configuration
   - "cloudflare workers rust" - runtime limitations and best practices
   - "leptos ssr" - server-side rendering implementation details
   - "wasm-bindgen web-sys" - browser API integration patterns

**Phase 3: Systematic Issue Resolution**
4. Fix issues in this priority order:
   - Cargo.toml dependency and feature flag corrections
   - Target-specific compilation issues (WASM vs native)
   - Leptos framework integration problems
   - Cloudflare Workers runtime compatibility issues
   - Development server configuration problems

**Phase 4: Implementation Validation**
5. Validate fixes by:
   - Ensuring `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` succeeds
   - Verifying development server starts without errors (`trunk serve` or equivalent)
   - Checking that wrangler can deploy the project (`wrangler deploy --dry-run`)

**Phase 5: Reference Implementation Comparison**
6. Compare implementation patterns against these specific repositories:
   - Cloudflare Workers Leptos template: Focus on wrangler.toml configuration and worker entry points
   - Official Leptos examples: Examine SSR setup and component patterns
   - SOQA SDK and Barter-rs: Review Rust project structure and dependency management

**Execution Guidelines:**
- Use task management tools to track progress through each phase
- Make multiple related changes in single tool calls to minimize cost
- Document all assumptions and decisions made during fixes
- Focus only on compilation and deployment issues - do not create tests unless specifically requested
- Provide specific error messages and line numbers when identifying issues
- Use batch updates for related configuration changes across multiple files
